Allows the user to input their choice (0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors).
Randomized Computer Choice:

Uses Python's random module to generate a random choice for the computer.
ASCII Art:

Displays visually appealing ASCII representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors based on choices.
Game Logic:

Compares user and computer choices to determine the winner, loser, or a draw.
Input Validation:
