Project Name: Tip Calculator
Project Description:
This project calculates the total bill amount including a tip and splits it among a specified number of people. It demonstrates basic mathematical operations, user input, and the concept of type conversion in Python.

Key Features:
User Input:

Captures the total bill amount.
Takes the desired tip percentage.
Asks for the number of people to split the bill.
Mathematical Calculations:

Calculates the total bill including the tip.
Divides the total bill among the specified number of people (optional enhancement).
Output:

Displays the calculated total bill with tip.

float() Function:
Converts user input into a floating-point number to handle decimal values (e.g., bill amount).

int() Function:
Converts user input into an integer for whole numbers (e.g., tip percentage and number of people).

Mathematical Operations:

1 + tip / 100: Converts the tip percentage into a multiplier.
bill * (1 + tip / 100): Calculates the total bill with the tip.
