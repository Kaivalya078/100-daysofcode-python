Notes for Hangman Game Code
Project Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game challenges the player to guess a randomly chosen word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses (lives) before the game ends.

Key Features
Random Word Selection:

The game selects a random word from word_list using the random.choice() method.
Player Feedback:

The current state of the word is displayed with underscores (_) for unguessed letters.
Visual feedback for the remaining lives is provided using stages from hangman_art.
Lives System:

The player has 6 lives. Each incorrect guess reduces the lives by one.
The game ends when lives reach 0 or the word is fully guessed.
Repeated Guesses:

Tracks letters that have already been guessed and provides a warning for repeated guesses.
Win/Lose Conditions:

Displays a win message if the word is guessed correctly.
Displays a loss message with the correct word if the player runs out of lives.
