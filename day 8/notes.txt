Notes for Caesar Cipher Program
Project Overview
This Python project is an implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique that shifts letters in the alphabet by a given number of positions. The program allows users to both encrypt and decrypt messages.

Key Features
Encryption & Decryption:

Users can input text and shift values to encode or decode messages.
Non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, numbers, symbols) remain unchanged.
Loop for Continuous Execution:

The program runs in a loop, allowing users to encode/decode multiple messages.
The user can exit the program by typing "no".
Modular Code with Functions:

The caesar() function handles both encryption and decryption.
Uses a simple logic: right shift for encoding and left shift for decoding.
User Input Handling:

Takes user input for message, shift amount, and encryption/decryption choice.
Ensures letters wrap around when shifting beyond 'z' (using modulus %).
